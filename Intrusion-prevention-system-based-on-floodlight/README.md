# Intrusion-prevention-system-based-on-floodlight
The linkage between snort and floodlight controller is realized to realize the floodlight-based intrusion prevention system

The centralized control of SDN and the characteristics of network programmability can realize centralized protection of the network. This project realizes an intrusion prevention system by linking the intrusion detection tool snort and the firewall module on the floodlight controller. The main idea is to integrate snort The OVS switch deployed on the data plane detects the traffic forwarded by the OVS switch, detects dangerous traffic according to the detection rules, and sends the warning message to the floodlight controller through socket communication, or transmits the warning message to the floodlight in JSON data format by creating a RESTful API The controller, after the floodlight controller receives the warning event, adds corresponding filtering rules on the firewall module, thereby preventing dangerous traffic and realizing the function of intrusion prevention.

Note: The code is written based on the floodlight 1.2 version, you need to download the floodlight 1.2 and then import the module into the floodlight project. The specific steps have been published to SDNLAB
